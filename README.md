# html-stop-light

This is a little HTML page with some JavaScript that will display a stop light.  It's a little toy to play with, but it's a great little tutorial for those trying to play with a little client-side JavaScript with HTML.

## Ideas for experimentation and learning

- Change the colors of the lights to something other than red, yellow, and green.
- Change the timing of the lights to something other than 5 seconds.
- Add text to the lights.
- Add some accessibility attributes to help folks who use screen readers.
- Add some CSS to make the lights look more like stop lights.
- Try using pictures of stop lights instead of colored boxes.
- Try using a JavaScript framework to do the same thing.
- Show this to a child, and see what they want to do. Do that.
